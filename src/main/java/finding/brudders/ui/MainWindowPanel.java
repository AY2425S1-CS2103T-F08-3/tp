/**
 * Represents the main window panel of the application that organizes layout and display of subpanels.
 * This class extends {@link HBox}, a horizontal box layout container in JavaFX, which arranges its children in a single
 * horizontal row.
 *
 * <p>This panel is designed to include a list panel on one side and a details or additional operations panel on the
 * other side.
 * It ensures that the application's main interface is divided into distinct sections for displaying lists of items and
 * their details or related operations.
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 * <pre>
 *     PersonListPanel personListPanel = new PersonListPanel();
 *     RightPanel rightPanel = new RightPanel();
 *     MainWindowPanel mainWindowPanel = new MainWindowPanel(personListPanel, rightPanel);
 * </pre>
