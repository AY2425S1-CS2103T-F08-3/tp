# FindingbrUdders User Guide

FindingbrUdders is a **desktop app for managing contacts and scheduling meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays contact details systematically, in a more human-readable format, while still allowing for fast typists to utilise the CLI and type out the desired commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer. 

    You can check the version by running `java -version` in the command terminal. <br>
    **Windows**: You can access the command terminal by pressing `Win + R` and typing `cmd` in the dialog box that appears. Press `Enter` to open the command terminal. <br>
    **Mac**: You can access the command terminal by pressing `Cmd + Space` and typing `Terminal` in the search bar that appears. Press `Enter` to open the command terminal. <br>

    To run any commands, type them in the command terminal and press `Enter`.

2. If you do not have Java installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html). 

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/releases/).

    Scroll to the very bottom of the page to find the latest release. Under the `Assets` section, download the `.jar` file by clicking on it.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FindingbrUdders app. This can be any folder on your computer, it can also be an empty folder.

1. Right click on the `.jar` file and select `Open with` and then `Java(TM) Platform SE binary`. 

   Alternatively, you can also run the `.jar` file by opening a command terminal, typing `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and using the `java -jar findingbrudders.jar` command to run the application.

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data to help you get started.<br>

![Ui](images/Ui.png) 

1. Type the command in the command box at the bottom and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/mUdder m/cs` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list and the Meetings associated with it.

   * `clear` : Deletes all Udders and Meetings.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning">

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FindingbrUdders will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it. You can do this by copying the `findingbrudders.json` file to a different folder.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the FindingbrUdders to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my Udder data to anudder(pun intended) Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer as per the Quick Start guide. Copy the `findingbrudders.json` file from the previous computer to the new computer. Replace the empty `findingbrudders.json` file in new computer with the `findingbrudders.json` file from the previous computer. Your `findingbrudders.json` file is located in the `data` folder of the directory where the `findingbrudders.jar` file is located.

**Q**: Can I undo a command in FindingbrUdders?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, there is no undo feature available at this time. Please double-check your inputs before executing any commands, especially for irreversible actions like deleting a contact.

**Q**: Can I change the location of the saved findingbrudders.json file?<br>
**A**: The location of the findingbrudders.json file is automatically set to the folder where the .jar file is stored. If you wish to change it, you need to move the .jar file to the desired folder, as the data file will follow.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. 
Solution: delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again. 
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. 
Solution: manually restore the minimized Help Window.
